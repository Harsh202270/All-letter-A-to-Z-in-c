# Alphabet Pattern Printing in C (A to Z)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to print **capital English alphabets from A to Z** using **pattern printing in C language**.  
Each alphabet is displayed using the character `1` and blank spaces, forming readable letter shapes on the console.

The program focuses on logic building using **nested loops** and **conditional statements**, without using any graphics libraries.

## 🛠️ Technology Used
- Programming Language: **C**
- Compiler: GCC / Online C Compiler
- Platform: Console-based application

---

## 📖 Description
In this program, each alphabet (A–Z) is created using a fixed number of rows and columns.  
The outer `for` loop controls the **rows**, while the inner `for` loop controls the **columns**.  

Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`) are used to decide:
- Where to print `1` (to form the alphabet shape)
- Where to print a space (to maintain alignment)

By modifying the conditions, different alphabet patterns can be generated.
